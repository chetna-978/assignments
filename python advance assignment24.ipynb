    "Q1. Permissibility of Using Several Import Statements for the Same Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Permissible: Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements for the same module. The goal may be to provide different aliases or names for the module, facilitating cleaner code or avoiding naming conflicts. It could be beneficial in situations where clarity or brevity is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Characteristics of a Module:\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristic: A module in Python is a file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions. It serves as a reusable unit of code, providing structure and organization to a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Avoiding Circular Importing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: Use techniques such as importing within functions rather than at the module level, restructuring code to eliminate mutual dependencies, or using conditional imports to break circular dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Purpose of __all__ in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: __all__ is a list defining the public interface of a module. It specifies which names should be imported when using the wildcard character (*) with \"from module import *.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Useful Situation for __name__ Attribute or String '__main__':\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: It is useful when you want to determine if a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module. It allows you to include code that should only run when the script is executed directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Benefits of Attaching a Program Counter to the RPN Interpreter Application:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits: Attaching a program counter allows tracking the position within the RPN script, facilitating debugging, error reporting, and providing the ability to implement features like breakpoints or stepping through the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Minimum Expressions/Statements for a Basic RPN Interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Requirements: At a minimum, a basic RPN interpreter would need expressions for arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), a stack to store intermediate results, and statements for reading and executing RPN instructions."
