    "Ans 1: The two operator overloading methods that you can use in your classes to support iteration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__iter__: This method should return an iterator object. It is called when the iteration is initialized, typically when the iter() function is called on the class instance.\n",
    "__next__: This method should return the next value from the iterator. It is called on the iterator object to get the next item in the iteration sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 2: The two operator overloading methods manage printing in the following contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "__str__: This method returns the \"informal\" or nicely printable string representation of an object. It is called by the print() function and by the str() conversion function.\n",
    "__repr__: This method returns the \"official\" string representation of an object. It is called by the repr() function and by the interactive interpreter when inspecting an object."
