    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects in Python?\n",
    "   - The feature responsible for generating Regex objects in Python is the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "   - Raw strings (strings with an 'r' prefix) are often used in Regex objects to prevent Python's string escape sequences from interfering with the regular expression pattern. For example, without the 'r' prefix, the string '\\n' would be interpreted as a newline character, whereas in a raw string, it remains as the two characters '\\n'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "   - The `search()` method returns a Match object if a match is found, and None if no match is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "   - To get the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object, you can use the `.group()` method or access the groups by their index. For example, if `match` is a Match object, `match.group(0)` gives the entire matched string, and `match.group(1)` gives the first captured group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex created from `r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)'`:\n",
    "   - Group 0 covers the entire matched string.\n",
    "   - Group 1 covers the first set of three digits in parentheses.\n",
    "   - Group 2 covers the second set of three digits separated by a hyphen.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, how can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "   - To match real parentheses and periods in regular expressions, you need to escape them with a backslash. For example, to match an actual parenthesis or period, use \\( to match '(', and \\. to match '.'.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "   - The `findall()` method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in the input string. If the regex pattern contains capturing groups, it returns a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a match and contains the captured groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "   - In regular expressions, the | character functions as an OR operator. It allows you to specify alternatives, so the pattern will match any of the alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character . stand for?\n",
    "   - In regular expressions, the . (period) character matches any character except a newline character (\\n).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "    - In regular expressions:\n",
    "      - `+` matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "      - `*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "    - `{4}` specifies that the preceding character or group must occur exactly four times, while `{4,5}` specifies that it must occur between four and five times.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "    - Shorthand character classes in regular expressions:\n",
    "      - `\\d`: Matches any digit (equivalent to [0-9]).\n",
    "      - `\\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric or underscore, equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]).\n",
    "      - `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "    - Shorthand character classes in regular expressions:\n",
    "      - `\\D`: Matches any non-digit character (equivalent to [^0-9]).\n",
    "      - `\\W`: Matches any non-word character (equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9_]).\n",
    "      - `\\S`: Matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .? and .* in regular expressions?\n",
    "    - `.?` matches either zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "    - `.*` matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "    - To match both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class, you can use `[0-9a-z]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regex case insensitive?\n",
    "    - To make a regular expression case-insensitive, you can pass the `re.IGNORECASE` (or `re.I`) flag as the second argument to `re.compile()`. For example: `re.compile(r'pattern', re.IGNORECASE)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if `re.DOTALL` is passed as 2nd argument in `re.compile()`?\n",
    "    - The . character in regular expressions normally matches any character except a newline (\\n). If `re.DOTALL` is passed as the second argument in `re.compile()`, it allows . to match any character, including newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If `numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+')`, what will `numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen')` return?\n",
    "    - `numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen')` will return the string `'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'`. It replaces all sequences of digits with 'X'.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing `re.VERBOSE` as the 2nd argument to `re.compile()` allow to do?\n",
    "    - Passing `re.VERBOSE` as the second argument to `re.compile()` allows you to write regular expressions with whitespace and comments. It means that whitespace within the pattern is ignored, and you can use # to add comments for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits?\n",
    "    - To match a number with a comma for every three digits, you can use the regex pattern: `\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe?\n",
    "    - To match the full name of someone whose last name is 'Watanabe', with the first name capitalized, you can use the regex: `[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*\\sWatanabe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence with specific first, second, and third words and ends with a period?\n",
    "    - To match a sentence with specific first, second, and third words and ends with a period (case-insensitive), you can use the regex: `(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s+(eats|pets|throws)\\s+(apples|cats|baseballs)\\.`.\n"
