    "Ans 1: An abstract superclass is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes but not instantiated directly. It contains methods that are declared but not implemented, known as abstract methods. Subclasses inheriting from an abstract superclass must implement these abstract methods, providing concrete implementations. The purpose of an abstract superclass is to define a common interface or behavior that its subclasses must adhere to."

This attribute is shared by all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name or any instance of the class. If a class attribute is modified using an instance, it creates a new instance attribute that shadows the class attribute for that specific instance."

    "Ans 3: A class needs to manually call a superclass's __init__ method to ensure that the superclass's initialization logic is executed. If a subclass overrides the __init__ method without calling the superclass's __init__, the superclass's initialization logic won't be executed, potentially leading to incorrect or unexpected behavior. By calling the superclass's __init__ method using super().__init__(), the subclass ensures that the superclass's initialization is properly executed."

This allows the subclass to add additional behavior before or after the superclass's method is called, effectively augmenting the inherited method."

    "Access to Attributes: Within a class, you can access class attributes and instance attributes using self. In contrast, within a function, you can access only local variables, function parameters, and global variables (if explicitly declared using the global keyword).\n",
    "Instance Access: Inside a class method, you have access to the instance (self), allowing you to modify instance attributes. Functions don't have this concept of instance access unless they are methods of a class.\n",
