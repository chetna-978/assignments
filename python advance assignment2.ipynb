    "Ans 5: In Python, the term \"self\" refers to the instance of the class. It is the first parameter in the method definition and is used to access instance variables and methods within the class. By convention, the name self is used, but you could technically use any name, although it's not recommended for readability and convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 6: Python allows operator overloading, which means that you can define custom behavior for built-in operators such as +, -, *, ==, etc., by implementing corresponding special methods (also known as magic methods or dunder methods) in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 7: Operator overloading should be considered when you want to give your objects the ability to mimic the behavior of built-in Python types or when it makes the code more intuitive and readable. Overloading operators can make the code more expressive and natural, especially when dealing with custom data types.\n",
