    "Naïve Bayes classifier is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence between features. It is named 'Naïve' because it assumes that the presence (or absence) of a particular feature of a class is unrelated to the presence (or absence) of any other feature, given the class variable.\n",

    "Optimal Bayes classifier is a classifier that makes decisions based on the posterior probabilities and selects the class with the highest posterior probability.\n",
