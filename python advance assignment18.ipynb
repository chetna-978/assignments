    "Q1. Differences between Text and Binary Files:\n",
    "Text files store data as plain text, encoding characters using a character set like ASCII or UTF-8. They are human-readable and contain newline characters to represent line breaks. Binary files, on the other hand, store data in a binary format, using sequences of bytes without encoding characters. They may contain non-textual data such as images, audio, or compiled code. Binary files are not human-readable and do not use newline characters for line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Scenarios for Text vs. Binary Files:\n",
    "Text files are suitable for storing human-readable data like plain text documents or configuration files. They are preferable when readability matters. Binary files are used for non-textual data, such as images or executables, where maintaining the exact binary structure is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Issues with Binary Operations on Python Integers:\n",
    "Issues may arise due to differences in integer sizes on different systems (endianness). Reading and writing integers directly as binary may lead to compatibility problems between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Benefit of Using \"with\" Keyword:\n",
    "Using the with keyword in Python for file operations ensures proper handling of resources. It automatically takes care of opening and closing the file, even if an exception occurs during the operation, providing cleaner and safer code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Trailing Newline in Python:\n",
    "When reading a line of text, Python includes the trailing newline character (\\n) in the string. When writing a line of text using write(), you need to include the newline explicitly if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. File Operations for Random Access:\n",
    "The seek() and tell() methods enable random-access operations on files. seek(offset, whence) sets the file position, and tell() returns the current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Usage of the struct Package:\n",
    "The struct package is often used when dealing with binary data, such as parsing binary file formats or network protocols. It facilitates packing and unpacking data into/from byte strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Best Option for Pickling:\n",
    "Pickling is the best option when you need to serialize complex Python objects (e.g., custom classes, data structures) into a byte stream for storage or transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Best Use of the shelve Package:\n",
    "The shelve package is best used when you need a persistent, dictionary-like storage for Python objects. It allows storing and retrieving objects using keys, maintaining their Python types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. Special Restriction with shelve Package:\n",
    "A special restriction with shelve is that keys must be strings, as they are stored as-is in the underlying database. This limitation distinguishes it from other data dictionaries that allow various key types."
