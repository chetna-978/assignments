    "1. Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Float:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Represents a wide range of values.\n",
    "Suitable for most general-purpose numeric calculations.\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "Limited precision due to the binary representation.\n",
    "May result in rounding errors in some arithmetic operations.\n",
    "Decimal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "Arbitrary precision, making it suitable for financial and decimal-based calculations.\n",
    "Avoids rounding issues associated with binary-based floats.\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "Generally slower performance compared to floats.\n",
    "Consumes more memory due to increased precision.\n",

    "2. Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2'):\n",
    "\n",
    "These are two different objects because they are created from different string representations.\n",
    "They represent the same mathematical value, but their internal states are different due to the different string representations.\n",

    "3. Equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2'):\n",
    "\n",
    "If the equality is checked (Decimal('1.200') == Decimal('1.2')), it will return True.\n",
    "The Decimal class compares values, not internal representations, so equality is based on mathematical equivalence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Preferable to start a Decimal object with a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting a Decimal object with a string ensures precise representation without any loss of information.\n",
    "Initializing from a floating-point value can introduce rounding errors inherent in binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Combining Decimal objects with integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Decimal objects with integers is straightforward and does not result in precision loss.\n",
    "For example, Decimal('3.14') + 2 works seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Combining Decimal objects and floating-point values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Decimal objects with floating-point values is possible, but the result is a Decimal object.\n",
    "Combining may involve rounding if the floating-point value has limited precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Example with Fraction class for absolute precision:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraction(1, 3) represents 1/3 with absolute precision using the Fraction class.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Quantity accurately expressed by Decimal or Fraction but not by a floating-point value:\n",
    "\n",
    "A repeating decimal like 1/3 can be accurately represented by Decimal or Fraction without rounding errors, whereas a floating-point representation may result in imprecision.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Internal state of Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(5, 10):\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal state of these two objects is the same because Fraction automatically simplifies fractions to their lowest terms during object creation.\n",
    "Both represent the fraction 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Relationship between Fraction class and integer type (int):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fraction class does not inherit from the integer type (int).\n",
    "There is no inheritance or containment relationship between them. Fraction objects can be created from integers, but they are distinct types."
